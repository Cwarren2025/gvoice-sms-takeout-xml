# gvoice-sms-takeout-xml
Convert Google Voice SMS data from Takeout to .xml suitable for use with SMS Backup and Restore

This is a personal project from a few years back when Google switched Voice to Hangouts and I wanted to grab my old messages and get them into a usable format. It worked at the time; I don't know if it works as-is, but I'm planning on some testing in the near term to get it functional. 

Input data is a folder of SMS .html files from Google Takeout.
